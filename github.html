    <h1>Github Commands</h1>
    <h4>
        <p>Github is a very powerful tool today. It provides the distributed version control of Git and
            accees control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis
            for every project.
        </p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Following are some important git commands which are used widely:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The git init command lets us create a new Git repository. This is the first command to start a new project
            in a GitHub repository. Go to the directory that contains your project files and run the git init command. A
            hidden .git subdirectory will be added to it.

        </li>

        <li>
            git clone creates a local working copy of the source code from a remote repository. When you clone a
            repository, the code will be automatically downloaded to your machine.
        </li>
        <li>
            git branch lets us add a new branch to an existing branch, view all existing branches, and delete a branch.
        </li>
        <li>
            The git checkout command allows us to switch to an existing branch or create and switch to a new branch. To
            achieve this, the branch you want to switch to should be present in your local system and the changes in
            your current branch should be committed or stashed before you make the switch. You can also use this command
            for checking out the files.
        </li>
        <li>
            The git adds command adds your changes in a file to the staging area where you can compare your local
            version and the version on the remote repository.

            Before you commit your new or modified file, it should be added to the staging area by using the git add
            command.
        </li>
        <li>
            git commit saves the changes in your local repository. Every time you commit your code changes, you have to
            include a brief description of the changes made. This commit message helps others understand the changes
            that have been done.
        </li>
        <li>
            The git push command pushes the committed file changes from the local repository to the remote repository so
            others can use them. It will also create a named branch in the remote repository if it does not exist.


        </li>
        <li>
            git pull fetches the last uploaded changes from the remote server into the local repository so that you can
            have the latest updates from your teammates.
        </li>
        <li>
            The git merge command merges your branch with the parent branch. The parent branch can either be a
            development or master branch depending on your workflow.

            It will automatically create a new commit if there are no conflicts. Before running the git merge command,
            you should be on the specific branch you want to merge with your parent branch.
        </li>
        <li>
            git status provides an overview of the current status of your repository.
        </li>
    </ul>
